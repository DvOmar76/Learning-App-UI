Introduction

In this project, you will design and develop a Learning App UI in
Flutter. This app will allow users to explore online courses, sign up,
and view course details. The main focus is on creating an engaging,
well-structured user interface with multiple screens.

📱 Core Screens to Implement:

✅ Splash Screen – Displays
the app logo.

✅ Onboarding Screens – Three
intro screens guiding users about the app.  
✅ Login & Sign-Up Screens – Allow users to register and log in.

✅ Home Screen – Displays user info, course categories, and available
courses.

✅ Course Details Screen –
Shows course description, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.
